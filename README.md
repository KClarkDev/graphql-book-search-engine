# Book Search Engine (MERN, GraphQL)

## Description

This MERN fullstack application utilizes a MongoDB NoSQL database, and allows users to create an account so they can search for books and save them to a favorites list. Users can also remove books from their list when they've finished reading them.

The starter code (linked below) was written with a RESTful API. This deployed application was refactored from this starter code to utilize graphQL.
